**Charity Wallet FrontEnd**:clipboard:

Main stack of this application: *TypeScript, React.JS, SCSS, HTML, OpenID*:stuck_out_tongue:

This is my *vision* for the implementation of this task.

**Project idea**:question:

The Charity Wallet allows you to receive information about the user’s purchases from any banks, round up the amount of these purchases with a given increment and send the difference to charitable foundations.

The application will be useful for those who want to make a contribution to charity, but do not know where to start and think that this requires a large investment.
